If it is a new contract ensure they provide a concise title following the UBS Naming Convention and a detailed description of their business need, project scope, expected deliverables, impact if not approved, type of contract, and cost. Refer them to the "Request Naming Convention" link for guidelines and the "See sourcing questions" link for additional guidance.

Ensure they use the table format to enter multiple financial entries and use the dropdown to select the funding type. Help them specify the cost center and GCRS company details. Inform clients that the expected amount will be automatically split by calendar year but can be manually adjusted, and the dates should reflect the contract duration.

5. Ensure clients provide a thorough "Cost Breakdown". Instruct them to provide a cost breakdown for the expected amount by selecting a spend type, inserting the expected delivery date and cost, and clicking the Add button to include the entry in the table. Ensure they understand at least one entry is required and that they can split costs among different spend types.
